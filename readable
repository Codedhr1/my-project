# QuickServe Booking Website

This project contains a simple service booking website and an admin dashboard. Bookings are stored in the browser using localStorage.

## Features

### Main Website
- Service cards and basic homepage
- Booking form (name, email, service, date, time, message)
- Saves bookings to localStorage

### Admin Dashboard
- Shows all bookings in a table
- Mark a booking as completed
- Delete a booking
- Updates localStorage automatically

## Files
- index.html — main website
- admin.html — admin dashboard

## How It Works
The form on the main site saves each booking into localStorage.  
The admin page reads the saved data and allows updating or deleting it.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a browser for the main site.  
Open `admin.html` to view or manage bookings.
